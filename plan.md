Project overview



1. Intro
    a. PyTorch deep learning overview on simple dataset (e.g. homodimer classification)

    b. Lightning + WandB for training and tracking

    c. Dropout blabla

2. Graph models on interface prediction task. Graphs: new model

    a. Graphs. Task for the hackaton (morning)

    b. Metrics. Auxiliary losses

    c. Start of the project.

        * Make a dataset

        * Make a baseline model

        * Start training and tracking

3. Transformers

    a. Attention -> transformer (pMPNN)

    b. ESMfold. pMPNN. AF2

    c. How can we add it on top of our model (embeddings + maybe clustering)

4. Continue working on the project

    a. They work

    b. At some point diffusion + SE3 invariance
